Validation Annotations
======================

- Use Java Validation API annotations (from ``javax.validation.constraints``) on model classes, including ``@Min``, ``@Max``, ``@Size``, ``@Email``, ``@NotBlank``, and ``@NotNull``
- Use ``@Valid`` on model objects in a controller to check for validation errors
- Explain how and when Spring validates model objects that are bound during a request
