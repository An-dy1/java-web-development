Studio: Spa User Validation
===========================

We’ll build on the `User Signup <../user-signup/>`__ studio from last
class, adding in model validation.

Getting Started
---------------

Open up your ``cheese-mvc`` application and navigate to the ``User``
model class.

Add Validation Annotations
--------------------------

Let’s take our first steps toward enabling validation. Add `validation
annotations <http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gircz.html>`__
to ensure these conditions are satisfied:

-  Username, password, and verify are required (they can’t be empty)
-  Username is between 5 and 15 characters
-  Email is optional
-  If provided, the email has the format of a valid email address.

   **How to do this**: The Java Validation API doesn’t provide an
   annotation to validate an email address. However, one is provided by
   the `Hibernate
   Validator <https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/validator/reference/en-US/html_single/#validator-defineconstraints-hv-constraints>`__
   library. This library is already in your project, since it’s included
   in the ``spring-boot-starter-web`` dependency that’s part of our
   Gradle configuration. You can use any of these annotations in the
   same way you’ve been using the Java Validation API annotations.
-  The password and verify fields match.

   **How to do this**: Your ``verify`` parameter in the form handler is
   not part of the user class, so checking that the ``User`` object’s
   password matches the ``verify`` isn’t possible using validation
   annotations. We’ll walk through these details on how to manually
   conduct this check below.
-  The password is at least 6 characters long

Using the Model to Render the Form
----------------------------------

In the ``UserController``, modify the ``add`` method that displays the
form so that it passes in an “empty” ``User`` object with:

.. code:: java

   model.addAttribute(new User());

This object will be accessible in the template, by name, as ``user``.
Within the template, use this object within the form by adding
``th:object="${user}"`` to the form element. Then you can use the
``th:for``, ``th:field`` and ``th:errors`` tags within the form as
outlined in the `lesson on
validation <../../videos/intro-to-spring-boot-model-validation>`__.

While you’re in the ``add.html`` template, make sure that the password
and verify fields have ``type="password"`` in the form markup, and that
the email field has ``type="email"``.

.. raw:: html

   <aside class="aside-pro-tip">

This last item will provide some client-side validation on the email
field, but we shouldn’t consider that sufficient. Even with client-side
validation (that is, in the browser), you should always validate data on
the server as well. You might want to provide constraints in addition to
or beyond what the browser does, and it’s also possible for a clever
(or, more often, malicious) user to bypass the browser’s validation.

Validating Form Submission Data
-------------------------------

.. raw:: html

   <aside class="aside-warning">

If you did any of the Bonus Missions in the previous studio, you’ll be
tearing out some of that code, since we’ll now have the framework handle
validation. Don’t worry, it’ll be worth it!

.. raw:: html

   </aside>

Now that you have your form set up, go back to ``UserController`` and
add validation on form submission by adding the ``@Valid`` annotation to
the ``User`` parameter that is bound, along with an additional
parameter: ``Errors errors``. **You must put this parameter directly
after the ``User`` parameter in the method definition for it to work
properly.**

Within the ``add`` handler, check for errors configured by the
validation annotation using ``errors.hasErrors()``. If this returns
``true``, return the user to the form. Be sure to add the ``user``
object to the ``model`` in this case: ``model.addAttribute(user)``. The
``user`` object contains the error messages associated with validation.

Validating That Passwords Match
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As we mentioned above, we are not able to use Spring’s validation
machinery to validate that the two password fields match given the setup
we have here. Checking ``errors.hasErrors()`` will only tell us if there
are errors in other form data fields.

To check that the two password fields match, you’ll need to manually
compare them. At this point, our method signature is:

.. code:: java

   public String add(Model model, @ModelAttribute @Valid User user,
                         Errors errors, String verify)

We can access the primary password field by using
``user.getPassword()``. Make sure that neither this value nor the
``verify`` variable are null, and then compare them with ``.equals()``.
If one of them is null, or if they don’t match, then add a custom error
message to ``model`` and clear the password field so it isn’t displayed
when we return the form: ``user.setPassword("")``. Finally, return the
form, and manually add markup in ``add.html`` to display this error.

Now we have two validation sections: one for the annotation-configured
validation (which checks ``errors.hasErrors()``), and one that checks
that the password fields match. Make sure they work in-sync with each
other to properly return to the form if any of the validation conditions
fail.

You can, in fact, validate that passwords match using annotations by
taking a slightly more difficult approach than we’ve done here. We
outline how to do so in the Bonus Mission section.

Test, Test, Test!
-----------------

You made a lot of changes! Be sure to throughly test them to make sure
everything works as expected.

Bonus Mission
-------------

Let’s set up our ``User`` class so we can validate that the password
fields match using annotations.

1. Add a ``private String verifyPassword`` field to ``User``, along with
   getters and setters.
2. Add a new method, ``private void checkPassword``, that compares
   ``password`` and ``verifyPassword``. If neither is ``null`` and they
   don’t match, then set ``verifyPassword = null``.
3. In both ``setPassword`` and ``setVerifyPassword``, call
   ``checkPassword`` **after** setting the given field.
4. Add ``@NotNull`` to the ``verifyPassword`` field with the error
   message: “Passwords do not match”.
5. Refactor the controller and ``add.html`` template to use the
   built-in, annotation-based validation instead of the manual password
   validation that we carried out previously. Be sure to update the
   verify field and label in the form to use the field on the ``User``
   class, and to remove ``String verify`` from the ``add`` method
   signature.

The result of these changes is that when the ``User`` object is bound to
the request, both ``password`` and ``verifyPassword`` are set. Spring
does this by calling the setters on these fields. The setters call
``checkPassword``, so when the second one is set (whichever that may
be), we’ll know that both ``password`` and ``verifyPassword`` are not
``null`` and we’ll compare them. If they don’t match, we manually
violate the ``@NotNull`` validation on ``verifyPassword`` by setting
that field to ``null``.
