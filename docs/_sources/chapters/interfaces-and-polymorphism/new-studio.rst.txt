Studio: Spinning the Discs
===========================

Although they look the same, the old optical discs---CDs and DVDs---are quite
different from each other. Let's use them as a model for creating a new
interface.

Getting Ready
--------------

   TODO: Add link to starter code repository.

Set up a local copy of the project:

#. Visit the repository page (*TODO: Add link here*)
   for this project and fork it to create a copy under your own GitHub account.
#. Back in IntelliJ, close any open projects.
#. On the IntelliJ welcome screen, click *Check out from Version Control* and
   select *Git*.
#. Choose your fork from the repository dropdown, select the parent directory
   where you'd like to store your project, and hit *Clone*.
#. In the first modal screen, select *Create project from existing sources*.
   Accept the default settings on all other screens.
