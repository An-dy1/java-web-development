Studio: Spa Day!
================

Today, we are going to use our knowledge of Thymeleaf to complete an application for a spa.

Our application needs to do the following:

#. Conditionally display a list of facials based on the customer's skin type.
#. Iteratively display the different types of massage available.
#. Use fragments to display other common services, such as a pedicure or manicure.
