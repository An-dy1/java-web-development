Your First Java Program
------------------------

By tradition, when you learn any new coding language, the first program you
write prints "Hello, World!" to the screen. We will follow this trend right
now.

#. Create a new folder to hold your Java practice files. Since you will be
   creating lots of short projects as you move through this course, we
   suggest that you also add sub-folders with names corresponding to the
   related chapters and projects. Something like
   ``java-practice/chapter-name/project-name``.
#. Open IntelliJ and select the *Create New Project* option from the welcome
   screen.

#. On the *New Project* screen, we will use all of the default settings. Just
   click *Next* in the lower corner of the second and third windows.
#. On the fourth window, enter ``HelloWorld`` for the name of the project.
   Click on the "3-dot" button to select a location to save the project.

      Create the ``HelloWorld`` project in the ``java-practice/data-types`` folder.

#. Click *Finish* to create the project.

Hello World
