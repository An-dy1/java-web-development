Learning Objectives
-------------------

#. Configure an individual class to be managed by Spring Data
#. Configure a one-to-many relationship to be managed by Spring Data
#. Configure a many-to-many relationship to be managed by Spring Data
#. Create a SQL report

.. _tech-jobs-persistent-setup:

Setup
-----

Connect a database to a Spring App.


Part 1: Persisting a Single Class
---------------------------------

Be sure you’ve completed the :ref:`setup steps <tech-jobs-persistent-setup>` before starting this
section.

If you get stuck on any of the steps here, refer to the video lesson, or
other code within the program that was provided. You’ll often find the
answers there.

Setting Up the New Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We’ll use Spring Data – along with JPA and Hibernate – to create an
object-relational mapping for a new class.

#. update the classes: Job + Employer

#. use the @Entity annotation

#. id creation, getters and setters, constructors

#. id annotation, generated value annotation

#. validation annotations on fields

.. In ``org.launchcode.models``, create a new model class named
.. ``Category``. Add the ``@Entity`` annotation to make the class
.. persistent In other words, this annotation will ensure that the class is
.. mapped to a relational database table.

.. Give it a private ``id`` field that’s an ``int``, along with a private
.. ``name`` property that’s a string. Add a public getter and setter for
.. ``name``, but only a getter for ``id``. Other classes shouldn’t be able
.. to change our ID!

.. Mimic the same JPA annotations used in ``Cheese``:

.. .. code:: java

..    @Id
..    @GeneratedValue
..    private int id;

..    @NotNull
..    @Size(min=3, max=15)
..    private String name;

.. Add two constructors to ``Category``. - Default (no-argument)
.. constructor: This is required, and doesn’t need a any code within its
.. body. It will only be used by Hibernate in the process of creating
.. objects from data retrieved from the database. - A constructor that
.. accepts a parameter to set ``name``.

Setting Up the Data Layer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. JobRepository interface creation, extend crud repo, transactional annotation

.. We’ll want instances of this class to be stored in the database, so
.. create a new interface in ``org.launchcode.models.data`` named
.. ``CategoryDao``. You can do this by creating a new class, and then
.. changing ``class`` to ``interface`` in the boilerplate code. It should
.. extend ``CrudRepository`` and have ``@Repository`` and
.. ``@Transactional`` annotations, as shown here:

.. .. code:: java

..    @Repository
..    @Transactional
..    public interface CategoryDao extends CrudRepository<Category, Integer> {
..    }

Adding Jobs
^^^^^^^^^^^

#. add JobRepository to homecontroller with @autowired annotation



.. Create a ``CategoryController`` in ``org.launchcode.controllers``. Add
.. the ``@Controller`` and ``@RequestMapping("category")`` annotations to
.. the class. Just inside the class, add:

.. .. code:: java

..    @Autowired
..    private CategoryDao categoryDao;

.. This creates a private field ``categoryDao`` of type ``CategoryDao``.
.. This object will be the mechanism with which we interact with objects
.. stored in the database. Recall that Spring will do the work of creating
.. a class that implements ``CategoryDao`` and putting one of those objects
.. in the ``categoryDao`` field when the application starts up. And all of
.. this is thanks to the ``@Autowired`` annotation.

.. This code would need to be added to each controller class that you want
.. to have access to the persistent collections defined within
.. ``categoryDao``.

.. .. raw:: html

..    <aside class="aside-warning">

.. We made the ``@Autowired`` annotation sound pretty dang magical! It’s
.. not that it isn’t, but don’t go adding ``@Autowired`` to every field
.. under the sun that you want to use and expect them to be initialized for
.. you.

.. Recall that ``@Autowired`` is part of Spring’s dependency injection
.. framework, and it works its magic in this case because we’re using
.. Spring’s ``CrudRepository`` interface, along with the ``@Repository``
.. annotations, and some other implicit Spring Boot settings.

.. .. raw:: html

..    </aside>

View All Jobs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. create view template for accessing individual job info.

.. Create an ``index`` handler within ``CategoryController``. Create an
.. ``index.html`` template file in ``resources/templates/category/`` (you
.. will have to create this last folder).

.. The ``index`` handler should correspond to the route ``""`` (that is,
.. the path ``/category``), and it should retrieve the list of all
.. categories. This is done via the ``categoryDao`` object:
.. ``categoryDao.findAll()`` returns a collection (actually, an
.. ``Iterable``) of all ``Category`` objects managed by ``categoryDao``.
.. Use this snippet to retrieve the list of categories, and then pass the
.. list into the view by adding it to ``model``. Also add a ``"title"`` to
.. the model (“Categories” works).

.. The handler should render the ``index.html`` template that you just
.. created. This view should display an unordered list (that is, a
.. ``<ul>``) of category names. The list will look a bit plain for now, but
.. we will make it more interesting later on.

Add Jobs
^^^^^^^^

Next, we want to enable the user to create a new category via a form.
This will require multiple steps.

Add Handler Methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let’s add controller handlers to render and process the form.

Create an ``add`` handler within ``CategoryController`` with input
parameter ``Model model``. It should create a new ``Category`` object
using the default constructor and pass it into the view with key
``"category"`` (you can do this with the shorthand
``model.addAttribute(new Category())``; note the omission of a
string/key argument). Add the title “Add Category” to ``model`` as well.

The ``add`` handler should accept ``GET`` requests at ``/category/add``
(recall that you set the path segment “category” at the controller level
already). The handler should render the ``category/add`` template (we’ll
add this template in a moment).

Create another ``add`` handler that accepts ``POST`` requests at
``/category/add``. Its signature should be:

.. code:: java

   public String add(Model model,
       @ModelAttribute @Valid Category category, Errors errors)

Within this second ``add`` handler: - Determine whether or not there are
any validation errors. If there are, return the form at
``category/add``. - If the form submission is valid: - Save the new
``Category`` object by calling ``categoryDao.save(category)``. -
Redirect to the ``index`` handler for ``CategoryController`` by
returning the string ``"redirect:"``.

Add View
^^^^^^^^

In ``resources/templates/category/`` create a new template,
``add.html``. Within the template, create a form that uses the
``category`` object that you passed in from the controller.

You’ll need to bind the object to the form using
``th:object="${category}"``. And you should use the appropriate
attributes within the form: ``th:for``, ``th:field``, ``th:errors``.

This is the same technique we’ve been using over the last couple of
weeks.

Adding Navigation Links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let’s make it easy to navigate to the new views that we’ve created.

Within the ``fragments.html`` template, add a link to ``/category`` to
the list of navigation links.

Within the ``category/index.html`` template, add a link to
``/category/add`` with the text “Add Category”. Place this link below
the list.

Test!
-----

Start up your application – don’t forget to start MAMP first – and try
to add a new category!

Click on the *Categories* navigation link, then on *Add Category*.
Complete the form, and if everything works as expected, you’ll see your
new category in the list. If everything seems to work – that is, you are
able to submit the form without any errors – but you don’t see your
category in the list, here’s what you should check:

-  Is there any data in the ``categories`` table? Check by going to MAMP
   and hitting the *Open Start Page* button, then navigating to *Tools >
   phpMyAdmin*. Find the ``cheese-mvc-data`` database, and look within
   the ``categories``. If there isn’t any data in the table, you
   probably forgot to save the category when processing the form.
-  If there’s data in the database, check that you are correctly
   querying for the list of all categories in
   ``CategoryController.index``: ``categoryDao.findAll()``.
-  Ensure you’re passing this list into the view, and looping over the
   list of categories to display them in the page.

When everything works, move on to `Part 2 <../one-to-many/>`__.
