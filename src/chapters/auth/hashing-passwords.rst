Hashing Passwords
=================

- keep data secure

One-Way Vs. Two-Way Encryption
------------------------------

- difference
- one-way 

Password Verification With Hashes
---------------------------------

- How a hash function makes password verification possible *and* secure 

What Makes a Good Password Hashing Function?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- hard to brute-force
- for similar inputs, gives very different outputs 
- deterministic
- hashing used for non-password purposes may violate some of these 

Hashing Isn't Perfect
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- collisions (cf SHA1)
- increase in computing power 

Which Hash Function Should I Use?
---------------------------------

- bcrypt
