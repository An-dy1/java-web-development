Studio: If It Ain't Broke, Add a Breakpoint!
============================================

On your machine, open up your copy of ``lsn7interfaces`` in IntelliJ. 
The purpose of this studio is to talk about your current debugging strategies 
and how to make the most of the debugger tools discussed in this chapter.

Before we start practicing with debugging tools, 
review with the group one error you encountered when working on your own version of lesson 7â€™s studio. 
This could be the result of a typo or a logical error.

#. What was the error?
#. How did you solve this error?  What stategies and tools have you been using so far to debug your code?
#. Could one of th debugging tools help you when addressing this error?

``TODO: need to re-create a buggy repo branch for students in java.``

Now, checkout the ``debugging *********** repo``.  
Review the code and used the debugging tools in IntelliJ to practice assessing the program.

To get started, try the following:

``TODO: Need to test this out in IntelliJ``

#. Add ``cd.Name  ***** test this`` to the *Watch Pane* ``CHECK THIS OUT``
#.  Add a few breakpoints inside ``PROGRAM.CS`` and make a note of where you expect the program to break in its execution
#. Add a breakpoint inside some of the methods in ``BASEDISC.cs``  
   Anticipate what you expect to see as the last line in the Call Stack when the debugger stops.


After you look through the code and try out these tasks, take it one step further by answering these questions.

``TODO: didn't mention the call stack in the Debugging section.  Could add if needed``

#. When would you use the Call Stack pane?  If you run the app and its already functioning, what shows up there?
#. Would a conditional breakpoint make sense to use in the context of this app?  
   Try changing one of the breakponts you have already added to a condigional breakpoint and run your app.

Once you have gone through the code, open up a piece o code you have been struggling with.
In what ways could you make use of the debugging tools to help you figure out what is going on with the code?
