Debugging in IntelliJ
=====================

Watch this video to learn the basics of the debugging tools available in IntelliJ.
If you want to follow along, Chris is working with ``ArrayListGradebook`` 
from the :ref:`Control Flow and Collections <array-list>` chapter 
and the ``HelloMethods`` and ``Message`` from  :ref:`Classes and Objects, Part 2 <static-methods-demo>` chapter.
You should have already downloaded this code from the ``java-web-dev-exercises``.  

Steps to Find and Diagnose Logical Bugs
---------------------------------------

- Set a **breakpoint** where you want to pause execution of the code. This will provide a more detailed look at what the program is doing at this point.  Right click in the text editing window to add a breakpoint to your code.
- Run your program in **Debug** mode
- Inspect the values of your variables in the **Debugger Pane**.
- If needed, use the **Add/Watch** button to watch a specific expression as your program executes.
- You can also set a **conditional breakpoint** to pause execution of the code when a certain condition is method

Control the Flow of Execution
-----------------------------

- **Setp-over** button executes a given line then steps to the next executable line
- **Step-into** button allows you to review a called method and see what is going to line within the method
- **Step-out-of** button allows you to move out of the method you stepped into and resume stepping through the main code

Advantage of Debugger Over Printing to the Console
--------------------------------------------------

- The debugger let's you look at **all** the values in your program instead of just guessing which values you want to track via logging to the console.

.. admonition:: Question

   What is a breakpoint?

   a.   A point in our code where the debugger will stop running and provide information about the current state.
   b.   A point in our code that we anticipate will result in an exception or error.
   c.   A point in our code where we include a print statement to see whatâ€™s going on.
   d.   A point in our code where we want to throw the computer out of a window because nothing works.
