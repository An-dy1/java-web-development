Thymeleaf Forms
================

Another fine use for a template is to use it to build a generic form. Then you
can render that template with different labels and data. This allows a single
form to serve different purposes, thereby saving you extra effort.

Whenever possible, reuse existing templates!

Try It!
--------

You will build a new practice project so you can work with templates and forms.
If you have not done so, commit and push any unsaved work from your
``hello-spring`` project.

Your new project will keep track of some fictional coding events. Start by
forking and cloning the starter code (*TODO: INSERT LINK*), then open it in
IntelliJ.

Now that you have rendered the events form, you need to add some code to
*handle* its submission. Code along with the video to add this functionality.
