Installing SQL
==============

.. index:: SQL

A couple of chapters in this book cover SQL.
Before we get started learning the ins and outs of the language, let's make sure we have everything properly installed!
For this class, we will be using MySQL version 8.0.18, the most current version.

Mac Users
---------

First, we need to install MySQL itself.
The `Community Server 8.0.18 download page <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/>`_ has a dropdown menu for the operating system you need.
Make sure you have selected MacOS before clicking *Download*!
You want to download the version called "macOS 10.14 (x86, 64-bit), DMG Archive".

#. When MySQL is done downloading, double-click on the disk image to launch the installer.
#. Click through the windows to install MySQL and agree to the terms and conditions.
#. When you reach the configuration window, you may have to enter a password for the root user. Pick a good password that you can remember!

Now that we have MySQL installed, we want to use it!
You can use MySQL in the terminal, however, many don't actually like it.
When working with MySQL in the terminal, all commands are final and you can't use any fun tools to visualize the tables.
Sounds like we should use a desktop client at first!

Now we need to install MySQL Workbench! 

The `MySQL Workbench 8.0.18 download page <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/>`_ has a dropdown menu for the operating system. Make sure MacOS is selected before downloading!

Once you have MySQL workbench installed, double-click on the disk image to launch the installer.
Agree to the terms and conditions and install.

Now, we can use MySQL workbench to access our databases and practice our commands!
